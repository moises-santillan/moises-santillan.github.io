**Overview**

Designed for graduate students in the MSc program in Biomedical Engineering and Physics at Cinvestav Monterrey, this course serves as a comprehensive introduction to the intersection of mathematics and life sciences. The curriculum bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theory and biological reality, focusing on **Nonlinear Dynamics**, **Bifurcation Theory**, and the art of **Mathematical Modeling**.

**What You Will Learn**

Students will explore biological phenomena across a vast spectrum—from the molecular mechanisms of a single cell to the complex interactions within entire ecosystems. By investigating classic models, you will master advanced mathematical and numerical-analysis techniques essential for modern research.

**Key Topics in the Curriculum**:

* **Fundamental Dynamics**: Explore ordinary differential equations through intriguing questions like "Why don't clouds fall?" and the mechanics of microbial swimming.
* **Growth & Decay Models**: Understand the stochastic processes behind exponential growth, radiocarbon dating, and the theoretical limits of bacterial populations.
* **Population & Evolutionary Dynamics**: Analyze logistic growth, inter-species competition, and how mathematical steady states explain Darwinian evolution and population extinction.
* **Epidemiology & Ecology**: Study the SIR model to understand disease transmission, the impact of vaccination, and predator-prey relationships through Competitive Lotka-Volterra equations.
* **Biological Oscillators**: Master the dynamics of biological rhythms, ranging from the Van der Pol oscillator to the foundational Hodgkin-Huxley and Fitzhugh-Nagumo models of neural activity.

**Learning Outcome**

By the conclusion of the term, students will possess a robust, working knowledge of Mathematical Biology, equipped with the tools to simulate, analyze, and predict the behavior of complex biological systems.
